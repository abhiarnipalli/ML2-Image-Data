# COVID Case Prediction Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a prediction algorithm using Python to assist in detecting COVID-19 cases. The model is trained using chest X-ray images of COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonia cases available on Kaggle. The project also incorporates linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Randomized Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to preprocess the image data.

## Skills Utilized
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Machine Learning
- Python (Programming Language)
